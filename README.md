# Ghost-Racer

## Objective
In Ghost Racer, the player has to free lost souls while driving though several obstacles. The player has to dodge pedestrians, shoot zombies with holy water, and avoid oil slicks. The player can also pick up goodies like healing kits and holy water refills. Once the player has freed all the lost souls, they move on to the next level.

## Game Rules
The player starts out the game with three lives. To complete a level, the player must free all the lost souls by driving over them. Each level has a random set of pedestrians, zombie pedestrians, zombie cabs, oil slicks, healing kits, and holy water refills. As the level progresses, the number of souls to save increases. If the player hits a human pedestrian the level ends and they lose a life. If they hit a zombie pedestrian or cab, their health points decrease. Once their health points reach zero, the level ends and they lose a life. The player can destroy zombie pedestrians and cabs by shooting holy water. The player can also increase their health points by driving over a healing kit or increase the number of holy water projectiles by driving over a holy water refill. If the player's total lives reaches zero, the game ends.
