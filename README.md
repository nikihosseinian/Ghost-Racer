## Rules
The player starts the game with three lives. To complete a level, the player must free all the lost souls by driving over them. Each level has a random set of human pedestrians, zombie pedestrians, zombie cabs, oil slicks, healing kits, and holy water refills. As the level progresses, the number of souls to save increases. If the player hits a human pedestrian the level ends and they lose a life. If they hit a zombie pedestrian or cab, their health points decrease. Once their health points reach zero, the level ends and they lose a life. The player can destroy zombie pedestrians and cabs by shooting holy water. If they drive over an oil slick, their car skids. The player can increase their health points by driving over a healing kit or increase their number of holy water sprays by driving over a holy water refill. Once the player has zero lives left, the game ends.
